# WeatherProject

A simple weather tracking website meant to run locally.

This project was originally built as part of Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp and expanded on with techniques learned in later lessons.

To run this project create a .env file in the file system on the same level as app.js and have a single variable in it named APIKEY. Once it is running simply type in a city name and Open Weather Map will search for and then display basic information such as the current weather, location, and current temperature in degrees Celcius.
